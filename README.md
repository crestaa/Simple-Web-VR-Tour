# Simple-Web-VR-Tour
Just a basic VR tour on webpage built with [VR View from Google](https://developers.google.com/vr/develop/web/vrview-web)
Demo visible through [GitHub Pages](https://crestaa.github.io/Simple-Web-VR-Tour/).

## Development
Just put your 360 images in the folder and fill the `views` array in the `index.html` file following instructions in the source code.

In future a GUI might be helpful.

## Build and run
Nothing to do here.

## User interactions
  - drag to look around
  - click on buttons to interact (i.e. to move around rooms)

Mobile UX still to be developed
